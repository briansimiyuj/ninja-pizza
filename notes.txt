GET method sends the data to the server in the URL.

When we use GET method, we need to specify action attribute in form tag.

This attribute points to the file where we want to send the data to. In this case, we are sending the data to the same file(add.php).

Now when we submit our form, the data gets sent to the server, server will look for the file specified in the action attribute and execute it.
